# Question Details
Create a list comprehension that modifies a list of strings by swapping the last two characters of each string. <br />

For example, if the list contains the strings ["hello", "comp", "student"] the modified list should contain ["helol", "copm", "studetn"].<br /> 

You may consider creating an auxiliary function to do this task (i.e. a function that takes a single string and swaps the last two letters).
