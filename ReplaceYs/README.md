# Problem Details

Write a list comprehension that takes a list of strings, and replaces all instances of "y" with "s", only if there are at least two y's in the word. <br />

You may create an auxiliary function to test whether a string has at least 2 y's. <br />

The list used will be: ["yesyy", "yoyo", "shady", "parise", "lady"]
