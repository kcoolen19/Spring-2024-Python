# PROBLEM DETAILS

Write a function list_interleave(..) that takes as parameters two lists of strings. <br />

The function creates a new list consisting of the interleaved respective strings of both lists. You may use the function developed in Question 2 for this task. Your function should throw an appopriate error if the lists have unequal sizes or if two of the respective strings have unequal lengths. <br />

For example list_interleave(["hi","bye"],["go","top"]) should return the list ["hgio","btyoep"]
