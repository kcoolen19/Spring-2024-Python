# Question Details
Write a script that takes a string and two floating point numbers from the console. The string is either: "sphere" or "cylinder". Note that the user may provide any form of the word in upper/lower case or a mix (hint convert the received string to lower). You may import the math library.
The program should return the volume of the shape, and handle any potential errors that a user may provide. 
Helpful formulas are:
  𝑉𝑠𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒=4/3 x 𝜋 x 𝑟3 
  𝑉𝑐𝑦𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟=𝜋 x 𝑟2 x ℎ
